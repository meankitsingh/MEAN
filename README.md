- **E**xpress (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- **A**ngular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
