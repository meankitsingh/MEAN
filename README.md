## MEAN stack


The stack is made up of:

- **M**ongoDB : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- **E**xpress (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- **A**ngular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- **N**ode.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
